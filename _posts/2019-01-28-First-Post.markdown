<h2>Hello there! It's my first post!</h2>

I'm April! I'm currently a junior here at Rutgers University, majoring in computer science. I’m working towards being a part of the video game industry, and in my spare time, I design and code games. Besides that, I’m highly interested in the arts. I enjoy making animations and illustrations, and I usually feature my art in my games. I am quite obsessed with a partner dance called west coast swing, too! As a member of the Rutgers Swing Dance Team, I learn under a professional coach and even go dancing in New York City almost every week. I’m hoping to become better so that I get to meet new people and do well in competitions!

That’s all about my interests so far! I hope to see you around!
