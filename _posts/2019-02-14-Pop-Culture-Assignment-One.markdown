<h2>Hello there! Take a look at who I think is a good role model today:</h2>
<h1></h1>

With the growing influence of the Internet nowadays, basically anyone can become famous. This can be quite dangerous, as we see the rise of ordinary people take part in unsettling and dangerous activities that became popular, such as eating Tide Pods, or driving blindfolded in the “Bird Box challenge.” Thus, I find that there is a lack of awareness towards one’s influence on the Internet. This is why I love Arin Hanson and Dan Avidan, cohosts of the popular Youtube series Game Grumps. Like a lot of good role models, they’re compassion, funny, and honest. Yet they also understand the scope of their fame, and absolutely refuse to let it control them. 

For one, they are true to themselves. I think it’s easy to let fame, or even a few likes on Twitter or Instagram, control how you present yourself online. However, Arin and Dan are genuine on Game Grumps, as they will talk extensively about their current situations or thoughts. Just earlier this year, they revealed that they were struggling with money, and had to reorganize their work schedule accordingly to pay their employees. Arin likewise actively takes pride in his new line of enamel pins, “Arpeegees,” expressing how much he loves the final product. The pair almost never filters their personality. Ultimately, they’re humble regardless of how famous they are, and they have no intention of hiding anything about themselves from their fans.

Most importantly, while being true to themselves, they still recognize their influence and use it to help others. I find this to be the most tricky to do online, since, while we enjoy being ourselves in our personal space, we tend to ignore what others are telling us. For Arin and Dan, however, their fame is a tool. With their fanbase, they were able to raise thousands of dollars for charities, like Child’s Play. They’ve additionally started a touring business, called “Real Good Touring,” to help other fellow Youtubers get money from touring. Arin has also started the “#CutieSaturday” on Twitter, where artists can post their art with the tag and Arin will retweet it. Though this does not sound as influential as his other accomplishments, this small but kind gesture has helped many artists out there get the exposure and the fanbase they need to continue freelancing. 

I’ve been a fan of Arin, Dan, and Game Grumps for years now, and while good character is definitely a quality of a famous role model, I want to highlight the importance of how one handles their fame. I witness a lot of people forget about their online presences, or their own true self, and sacrifice either one or the other because of fame. I find that Arin and Dan have found a good balance between the two though, and are good role models because of so.
