“Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life,” 
Is the quote I’m not trying to find at the moment, 
But it’s the quote that Google is giving me.

“Do what you love, and you’ll take it personally, and you’ll obsess over making it perfect,”
Is the kind of quote I’m looking for,
As I sit here, looking at the calendar and to-do list that’s stuck on my desktop,
But nothing else would make me happier, than,
Designing video games as a career,
Creating art for my savings,
Dancing for date night money,
There’s no other path I would rather take. 

But looking at the calendar and to-do list that’s stuck on my desktop, 
The deadlines give me dread, 
The assignments make me scared, 
The grades send a shiver down my spine,
I want to work hard, because this is where I want to be,
And this is what I’d like to do.

“Do what you love and you’ll work super hard with no separation or any boundaries and also take everything extremely personally,”
Is the quote I’m looking for,
Found on a lonely twitter post by Adam Kurtz,
And I feel the words living on my body,
Classes is living in my eyes,
Aresty Research is living in my brain,
Exams are living in my stomach,
But I’d like to change that quote to, before it’s too late,
“Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.”
