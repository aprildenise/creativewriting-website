<h2>Hey there, again! There are my opinions about the infamous Gillette commercial:</h2>
<h1></h1>

Other things I reference:
[Fox News][Fox]
[Nike][Nike]

The infamous Gillette advertisement, titled "We Believe: The Best Men Can Be," is perhaps the most disliked video so far in 2019. This is because many loyal customers of the brand find that the commercial, which was initially intentioned to raise awareness about toxic masculinity, is meant to harmfully slander men and their behaviors. Many critics also believe that this is a publicity stunt to help bring Gillette sales, and the overall message of these social campaign commercial shouldn't be taken seriously. However, I believe the opposite. I find that this in fact attempts to praise men, and that ad campaigns like these are helpful for the social movements.
 
Firstly, the advertisement is not attacking men. As Fox News suggests, watching this advertisement feels like that the concept of toxic masculinity defines all men, even those men that are trying to help women. It's true that they depict only men acting inappropriately, such as the man groping the woman on set, as well as the two young boys fighting in the backyard. However, there are many touching moments of men showing compassion and being strong as well. This includes a father, telling her daughter that she is strong, and the two men towards the end of the video, who, after a dispute, immediately calm down and shake hands. Most importantly, the final scene, which is generally the most pivotal part of an ad campaign, no longer presents men acting inappropriately in public. It actually features shots of young boys, as the narrator of the advertisement encourages its audience to be leaders of society. This, to me, does not seem to be slandering men at all. Hence, I do not believe this commercial is actually against men, but actually praising them for their kindness and leadership.
 
Besides the contents of the ad, it is also wrong to assume that these commercials arenâ€™t effective for social change because they are meant to raise sales. Many have noted that, after watching this Gillette ad, they weren't sure what Gillette was selling them. The commercial actually doesn't feature any products of Gillette, besides their logo and slogan. In fact, one of the commenters on Fox News suggests that a better advertisement for Gillette would simply be a video of a clean shave. These comments emphasize that these commercials are not meant to sell a product or their brand. Note that the Fox News commenters, in fact, generally talk about the message, and not the brand. Nike's commercial, "Just Do It," featuring Colin Kaepernick does similarly. This advertisement was meant to advocate minorities, and while there are Nike products in the video, no one on the scene even mentions it. Hence, it is wrong to assume that brands like these should not touch upon politics or social change since the intention is not to earn money but convey a message.
 
Ultimately, I am strong supporter of this advertisement. Of course, I see that it isn't the best ad campaign about toxic masculinity. The women on Fox News make an insightful comment that Gillette can make the ad better by displaying more instances of men guiding others and being leaders. This I agree with, since it's easier for people to follow by example. Regardless, the Gillette ad is meant to praise ethical actions among men and is not detrimental for social movement.
